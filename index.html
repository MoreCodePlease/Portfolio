                <li>ABOUT ME</li>
                    <p>It's incredible how certain words on a page can bring forth what the world sees and interacts with every day! I look forward to working with others on our next great project!</p>
                    <p>If there's a chance to journey into the outdoors, ill take it! I love being around nature. In the woods, on the water, and under! My family is important to me, and I love including them in my experiences wherever I go.</p>
